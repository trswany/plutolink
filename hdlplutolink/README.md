# PlutoLink HDL Project

These build files (Makefile, TCL scripts, constraints, and verilog top-level)
were taken from the https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/hdl project. Per the
README in that project, the build systems was licensed under the BSD 1-clause
license and was designed to be adapted/modified for new projects. I have
copied them into the PlutoLink project to keep the changes contained in a
single repo.
